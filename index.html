            <p>HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is the backbone of all websites. It provides the structure in which elements
                of the page are styled and how the user will navigate through the website or app. </p>

            <p> Every website follows a basic format which includes a header, a body and a footer. Even if you don't notice it
                when you regularly use the web it is present and makes the experience enjoyable and easily interactive </p>

            <p> Throughout this technical documentartion of HTML we will discuss several concepts including but not limited to:
            tags, creating lists, and organizing your text code into compartments called divs. Let's get started! </p>

        <article>
            <p>Tags are what is used in HTML to help define what is actually going on with the test. Here I will list several
                of the most common and most used tags that you can use to start building your very own website.</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Code</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code> < !DOCTYPE html ></code> </td>
                    <td>Ironically the first one is not a tag but must be included before everything else. It is an instruction
                        to the web browser and tells it what version it is running.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>

                    <td>

                    </td>
                    <td>The head tag contains information like scripts, styles and/or even a title for the page</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>< title ></code>
                    </td>
                    <td>The title tag is required in all HTML and will display the title of the page in the browser window</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code> < body > </code>
                    </td>
                    <td>The body tag will contain all of the elements in the actual html so all of the text, images, lists and
                        so on</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>< h1 > to < h6 ></code>
                    </td>
                    <td>Now we actually get to writing text for the page. These are heading tags. h1 by default being the biggest
                        in text size all the way down to h6. These are helpful to oranize information.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>< p ></code>
                    </td>
                    <td>This tag denotes a paragraph for your text.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code>< br ></code>
                    </td>
                    <td>Using this tag will add a break to your text since just hitting enter won't actually do anyhing</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <code> < hr ></code>
                    </td>
                    <td>This tag will add a horizontal line to your page and help to organize content.</td>

            </table>
            <p>
                It is
                <strong>IMPORTANT</strong> to note that almost all tags (there are a few exceptions) need a closing tag. So for example
                if you make a paragraph using
                <code> < p > </code> you need to close the tag after your paragraph like this
                <code> < /p > </code>
            </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="comments">
        <header> Comment </header>
        <article>
            <p> Adding comments in your HTML is incredibly useful to yourself and other coders in the future who will be reading
                your code. It allows you to type an instruction or a note in the code without affecting your actual HTML.</p>

            <p> To do this you would type
                <code> < !-- ... -- > </code>
                <p> You can type this anywhere in the HTML whether it be before a div tag noting what the div is holding or you
                    could add it after a hex code to show what it is representing. It is up to you how you want to add notes
                    to your code but it is a very good habit to get into. </p>
        </article>

    <section class="main-section" id="attributes">
        <header> Attributes </header>
        <article>
            <p> An attribute in HTML can do two things:
                <ol>
                    <li> Modifies default functionality of the element type </li>
                    <li> Provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Generally the syntax for attributes is as follows
                    <code>< element attribute="value" > Content in the tag < /element > </code>
                    <p>
                        Some examples of attributes include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <code> < src > </code> which stands for source. You'll use this and the link for an image you want to add.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code> < href > </code> will make text into a clickable link </li>
                            <li>
                                <code> < id > </code> gives an element a unique identification which becomes useful when you start using CSS
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <code> < class > </code> is another common attribute used in assisting your CSS code </li>
                            <li>
                                <code> < width > and < height > </code> are two attributes that do exactly what you think they do. Very useful in sizing images
                                or other content. </li>
                        </ul>
    </section>
    </article>

    <section class="main-section" id="adding_images">
        <header> Adding Images to Your Website </header>
        <article>
            <p> Images are a great way to make your website really stand out from the rest. From getting the pictures off the
                internet, sizing them and even turning them into a link you can make your page stand out from the rest. </p>

            <p> We talked earlier about tags and how they need to be closed. Well this tag is one of the exceptions. The img
                tag does not need to be closed. It is referred to as self-closing. </p>
            <p> The common syntax for adding an image </p>
            <code> < img src= " " > </code>
            <p> Now there are many things you can do with said image once you've got it on your page. You can control the height
                and width using the attributes we went over earlier in the last section </p>
            <code> height = "100px" width = "100px" </code>
            <p> This will make your image 100 pixels tall by 100 pixels wide. </p>
            <p> Another cool thing you can do is turn your image into a link like this </p>
            <code> < a href = "Linktopicture" > </code>
            <p> And once you have your link you put the a tag around the image tag so once you have all of the subsequent images
                in place it will look like this </p>
            <code> < a href = "link" > 
                  <br> 
                  < img src="picture-link" width = "100px" height = "10px" > 
                  <br> < / a > 
                  </code>
            <p> These are just some of the basics when it comes to images. It is up to YOU what images you want to use and how
                you want to style them. </p>
            <p>
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> If for some reason your picture won't load it is always recommended you include an alt attribute
                at the end of the picture with a short description of what it is. So for example if I linked a picture of
                a child holdin a ballon and it didn't load my alt attribute would take it's place in plain text. </p>
        </article> 
    </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="f_text">
            <header> Format Text </header>
            <article>
                <p> You may find it useful to format your text when you want to make something bold or italic. Thankfully, there
                    are some really simple and helpful tags to help make certain words stand out from the rest. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code> < strong > </code> makes your text look important </li>
                    <li>
                        <code> < i > </code> will give the text an italic style </li>
                    <li>
                        <code> < mark > </code> will highlight text for you </li>
                </ul>
                <p> Proper syntax for formatting text is nesting the word inside the tag. It will look something like this
                </p>
                <code> < b > This text will be bold < / b > </code>
                  <p> And that works for any of the format tags. You can even nest a formatted text within another tag.
                  </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="create_list">
            <header> Creating Lists </header>
            <article>
                <p> If you couldn't tell from this Technical Document page I love lists and you will too once you know how to
                    create them in HTML. There are two different kinds of lists </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Ordered Lists </li>
                    <li> Unordered Lists </li>
                </ol>
                <p> Ordered lists will have a number next to them and unordered will have a dot. You can always go to CSS and
                    format the numbers and dots how you want but for now we will just stick to making the default lists.
                    </p>
                <p> To make the list you use this block of code </p>
                <code> < ol > <br>
                      < li > List Item #1 < /li > <br>
                      < li > List Item #2 < /li > <br> 
                      < li > List Item #3 < /li > <br>
                        < /ol > </code>
                <p> So as you can see there's a couple different things we have going on here. First, we open up our ordered
                    list tag. Second, we have our list items in the opening and closing li tags. Finally, we have to close
                    the ordered list tag. If you wanted an unordered list you would just use </p>
                <code> < ul > < /ul > </code>
                <p> But still use the same li tags in the list to actually create the list. </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="b_elements">
            <header> Block Elements </header>
            <article>
                <p> It is very important to organize in your HTML because once you introduce CSS and JavaScript you will start
                    to run into conflicting id's and classes. Adding block elements or the div tag gives your page:
                    <ul>
                        <li>more structure and organization </li>
                        <li> a container to style CSS or perform certain tasks with JavaScript </li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p> Div tags work like this </p>
                <code> < div > < / div > </code>
                </p> And you can put content inside the div tags like a heading or an image for example. </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="nesting">
            <header> Nesting </header>
            <article>
                <p> Nesting elements becomes very important when you want to put similar information together all in one container
                    or div. Doing this allows you to keep your HTML looking tight and organized. </p>
                <p> To nest items it looks like this. </p>
                <code> < div > <br>
                      < h1 > Hello World < /h1 > <br>
                        < p > This is a paragraph < /p > <br>
                          < /div >
                            </code>
                <p> So basically you can put as many elements as you want into a single div and then they will be considered
                    nested! </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="b_form">
            <header> Building a Form </header>
            <article>
                <p> By building a form with just HTML you open up the option for the user to input any information (usernames,
                    passwords, email) and have that information sent to your database. Let me show you how in a couple of
                    quick steps </p>
                <p> First you want to make the form </p>
                <code> < form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data" > < /form > </code>
                <p> Then you want to add a button so your user can submit their information to you </p>
                <code> < button type="submit">this button submits the form < /button > </code>
                <p> And when you put it all together with the text field nested in the form element you will have something that
                    looks like this </p>
                <code> < form action="/submit-name" > <br>
                < input type="text" placeholder="Your Name Here" > <br>
                < button type="submit" > Submit < /button > <br>
              < /form >
                </code>
                <p> And now you have yourself an element where a user can enter their name or anything. The placeholder will
                    give the form a pre-set text so it gives your user some idea of where to put the information and in what
                    way. You're totally in control!
                </p>
